  - Visual consistency
  - Accessibility checks
- Identified major UX and UI issues such as:
  - Inconsistent typography
  - Unclear content hierarchy
  - Visual clutter and bugs
  - Poor color contrast
  - Navigation redundancy

### 🎯 Goals & Scope Defined

  - Frontend interaction improvements

### 🧭 Structure & Strategy – Information Architecture & Flow Planning

This section covers foundational analysis and planning to improve the structure, navigation, and usability of the KubeStellar documentation.

#### ✅ Review of Current Information Architecture (IA)

- Analyzed existing doc structure across:
  - Overview
  - Setup
  - Usage
  - UI
  - Community sections
- Found fragmented content, duplicate topics, and inconsistent labeling.

#### 📁 Observations & Proposed Hierarchy Improvements

- Mixed technical/conceptual content without clear organization
- Proposed a max of 3-level deep nested hierarchy
- Suggested clearer top-level groups:
  - Getting Started
  - Usage
  - Troubleshooting
  - Contributing
- Recommended removing or renaming generic paths like `/direct/`

#### 🧭 Navigation Design Audit

##### 🔹 Header

- **Issues**: Low contrast buttons; missing version and language switchers
- **Recommendations**: Use clear button styles; add dropdowns for versioning and multilingual support

##### 🔹 Sidebar

- **Issues**: Non-collapsible menus; poor hierarchy; confusing URLs
- **Recommendations**: Implement collapsible sections; improve naming; highlight current section; remove `/direct/`

##### 🔹 Footer

- **Needs**:
  - “Was this helpful?” feedback buttons
  - GitHub "Edit this page" links
  - Community links
  - License and privacy info

##### 🔹 Breadcrumbs

- **Status**: Missing entirely
- **Recommendation**: Add a breadcrumb trail to support user orientation

#### 🔄 Key User Flows Mapped

##### 1. Manual Setup Flow

- **Goal**: Manually install KubeStellar using CLI, Helm, and KubeFlex
- **Issues**: Dispersed setup steps; redundant cluster info
- **Recommendations**: Create a unified guide; add lifecycle diagrams

##### 2. OCM-Based Setup Flow

- **Goal**: Automate setup via Open Cluster Management (OCM)
- **Issues**: Lacks clarity on use-case choice; no validation steps
- **Recommendations**: Add setup comparison chart; insert CLI output examples and diagrams

##### 3. Workload Execution Flow

- **Goal**: Register clusters and deploy workloads
- **Issues**: Disconnected content; no step-by-step guidance
- **Recommendations**: Create end-to-end deployment guide with YAML + CLI examples

##### 4. Teardown Flow

- **Goal**: Cleanly uninstall KubeStellar
- **Issues**: No rollback or backup guidance; lacks automation
- **Recommendations**: Add pre-teardown checklist; CLI cleanup scripts; multi-cluster handling

#### 🚧 Identified Content & Functional Gaps

- No Quickstart guide for first-time users
- Duplicate Hosting Cluster setup across docs
- UI documentation lacks structure and visuals
- API docs are fragmented with minimal context
- Troubleshooting section is hard to scan
- Known Issues aren't categorized by severity
- Contribution docs need more clarity and depth
- Missing full-text search functionality
- No user feedback mechanisms
- Diagrams and visuals are absent from key pages
- No glossary for technical terms (e.g., WEC, ITS)

### 🧪 User Research & Interviews Conducted

- Conducted user interviews and research to understand:
  - Common navigation pain points
  - Confusing flows in the current IA
  - User expectations from documentation and setup guides
- Insights helped inform the new IA and navigation recommendations

### 🔳 Wireframes Designed

- Developed low-fidelity wireframes for:
  - Documentation homepage layout
  - Setup guide experience
  - Component structure (inputs, buttons, sidebars)
- Used layout grid and spacing tokens from the design system
- Aligned wireframes with IA improvements


### 🔤 Type Hierarchy Defined

- Established a consistent typography system for the documentation and UI
- Defined font sizes, weights, and heading structures aligned with visual hierarchy
- Resource: [Type Hierarchy – Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/Gi24EeUOBqcWbdutYEPlE4/Type-Hierarchy?node-id=0-1&t=XXfQVjh9T7DgVtXB-1)

### Additional Progress

- **Navigation Mapping Updated**: Created a revised navigation structure in FigJam to align with improved information architecture and mapped user flows.

- **Information Architecture Refined**: Enhanced the structure of documentation based on audit results and user research, ensuring better organization, hierarchy, and clarity.

- **Typography Finalized**: Completed the typography hierarchy in Figma, establishing consistent type scales for headings, body text, and labels to improve readability and accessibility.

### 🔍 Research on Next.js framework for Documentation

- **Objective**: Explore better alternatives for the documentation site framework with a focus on SEO, performance, and developer experience.
- **Findings**:
  - Next.js offers **strong SEO** capabilities out-of-the-box due to SSR and static generation.
  - Supports **MDX**, making it easier to write interactive documentation in markdown with React components.
  - Excellent integration with **search engines** and analytics.
  - Better **routing flexibility** and support for multilingual content.
- **Outcome**: Decided to proceed with a Next.js-based setup (considering Nextra or Mintlify) for the redesigned documentation system to enhance visibility and maintainability.

### 🧠 Brainstorming – Program Page Content

- Initiated content brainstorming for a dedicated **Program Page** to showcase KubeStellar-related opportunities such as mentorships, contributor programs, or events.
- The goal is to provide a structured, user-friendly page that helps visitors quickly understand the program and how to participate.

### 🎨 KubeStellar/docs Landing Page Design – Navigation Bar

- Designed a clean and accessible **navbar** for the documentation landing page:
  - **Logo** (top-left) links to the home page
  - **Top-level navigation links**:
    - Docs
    - Community
    - Contribute
    - Blog

  - **Right-aligned utilities**:
    - Version dropdown (e.g., v0.9.0, v1.0.0)
    - Language switcher (for multilingual support)
    - GitHub icon linking to the main repo
  - **Sticky header** with smooth scroll and shadow for better visibility
