#  Kubestellar UI/UX Design Guidelines

The [CNCF - KubeStellar: Design System Foundations Project](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/1cd69035-2bab-47f1-9774-952e9ec0d43e) 
is tasked with developing a common style guide, design elements and taxonomy for use across KubeStellar, UIs and website to provide a uniform user experience (UX) across its scope.

This file will be used to maintain a record in the UI repository as the guidelines are developed.
