# Test Spellcheck Workflow

This is a test file to verify that our spellcheck workflow is working correctly.

## Intentional Misspellings (for testing)

- misspeled (should be "misspelled")
- recieve (should be "receive")
- seperate (should be "separate")
- accomodate (should be "accommodate")
- definately (should be "definitely")

## Correct Spellings

- Kubernetes
- KubeStellar
- API
- JSON
- Markdown

This file should trigger the spellcheck workflow and catch the intentional misspellings.
